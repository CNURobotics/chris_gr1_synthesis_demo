# A synthesis request consists of the system (robot)
# for which to synthesize a behavior, the system's initial conditions,
# the desired objective(s) and the resulting state machine's outcomes.

# The system's initial conditions
# Provided by the user when offline.
# Can be inferred when the system is online (not implemented)
string initial_condition

# The system's objective(s)
# All have to be achieved for a state machine's run to be successsful.
string goal

# The outcomes of the resulting synthesized state machine
# Empty for vanilla synthesized automata (infinite execution)
# By convention, 'finished' and 'failed' are used for success and failure
